This is a collection of my Python code snippits.
As of 12-4-21, I have 242 completed challenges with Code Wars. You can see my Code Wars profile at:

I'm going to add the more complex challenges on here.
The ranking for Code Wars starts at Level 8 Kata as the easiest and goes down to Level 1 Kata as the hardest.
The ranking for accounts is similar to the challenges, going from Level 8 Kyu down to Level 1 Kyu. At the time of adding my challenges, I am a Level 4 Kyu.

For the best examples of my Python programming skills, check out my Level 4 Kata. Those are the highest difficulty challenges I've achieved so far. They are:

Human_Readable_Duration_Format.py,
Strip_Comments.py, and
Sudoku_Solution_Validator.py
